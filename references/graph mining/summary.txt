GrouMiner
1. create groums
2. mine pattern by PattExplorer algorithm
	idea of the algorithm: 
		1. find subgraph size k+1 from graph size k
		2. employs an aproximate vector-based approach ? Exas charateristic vecto
advantages: ...
disadvantages: ...



Biggroum
1. create groums
2. cluter groums by itemset mining
3. mine patterns of each cluster by a three-step framework
	1. slice
	2. bining
	3. classification

advantages: ... clustering help mine patterns more efficient
disadvantages:
1. graph mining method: read more detail in the paper (focus on miner pattern section)
2. output pattern: for some clusters the miner doesn't generate any pattern althought the number of input groups is large.

		
	
Subdue
advantages:
1. a heuristic graph mining algorithm
2. based on MDL principle.

could be replaced the graph miner in Biggroum?
how to improve Subdue for mining usage patterns?
