Top-K frequent subgraph mining:
-------------------------------
Tgp: Mining top-k frequent closed graph pattern without minimum support[Li,2010]

kFSIM: Top-k frequent induced subgraph mining using sampling [Duong,2016]

TKG: Efficient Mining of Top-K Frequent Subgraphs [Philippe Fournier-Viger,2019]
	proposed algorithm utilizes a novel search space traversal approach called dynamic search to always explore the most promising patterns first
	this algorithm aims to find top-k patterns which have highest support.
	these patterns are not interesting in the sence of source code patterns
	because they reflect the most common structure of the programming languages.
	However, in the context of mining source code patterns we would like to find 
	patterns which contain detail. These patterns usually have very low support.
	
	In short, top-k frequent subtree mining approaches are not suitable to mine
	source code patterns.
	

Sampling approach subgraph mining:
----------------------------------

Output space sampling for graph patterns [Hasan,2009]

Constraint-based pattern subtree mining

Notes:
===================================

1. Exhaustive search
- FREQT, .... 
	yeild large numbers of patterns
	
- Top-k frequent subtree mining
	yeild small numbers of patterns with high support
	
- Constraint-based pattern mining
	yeild a small numbers of patterns
	easier interpret the patterns found under given constraints
	not scale for large software source code
	
--> proposal: sampling approach
	trade off between performance and completeness/accuracy
